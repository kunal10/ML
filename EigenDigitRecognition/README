Steps to run the code:

1) Unzip the zip folder.

2) Make the unzipped folder as your current folder in Matlab.

3) In command window run the following command:
   main

Main Functions :

1) hw1FindEigenDigits : Returns the mean of sample data and the normalized eigen vectors.

2) constructImage : Takes an array of 784 dimensional feature vectors, projects it onto a basis and constructs a concatenated image comprising of all the projections.

3) findPrincipalComponents : Finds top k principal components. We had also implemented another version which finds top k (unknown) components such that their eigen values compries of a predefined fraction of total energy.

4) training : Trains a kNN model from the sample data

5) test : Tests the data using the passed model and returns the accuray.
